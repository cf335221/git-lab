Answer 3: when I type "git --help" it shows me a screen that has a lot of relevant commands for when you are using git. 

Answer 4: It says I have no commits yet. It also says I have two untracked files, README.md and answers.md. Both files are also shown in red letters.

Answer 5: I got the same output as answer 4 with one change. The "README.md" now longer shows in untracked files. The file "README.md" now shows under "changes to be commited". The file named "README.md" also shows in green letters now.  

Answer 6: I got the same output as answer 5, but now both files (README.md and answers.md) show under "changes to be commited" and they are both now in green letters.
